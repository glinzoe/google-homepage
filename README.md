This is a google homepage project, quite a basic one with only necessary elements
and similar placements. 

Objective
To start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get
styled and aligned. 

Skills Used
Used CSS flexbox and grid. 
Semantics and accesbility.
css fonts, element placements

Final Reflections
was way harder than it looked, element placement and applying styles is harder than it looks.
have a problem with footer, I don't know how to make it stick to the bottom. probably will make changes to the code once I have it figured out.
for now I am satsisfied with how the page looks.
developer's tools are life-saving tools, saved me a tonne of time and headache when nothing else seemed to be working.
What I learned from this was that most important thing while programming is the ability to find solutions to small issues.
knowing where to look is half the work.
